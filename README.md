# Cat Gallery App

## Project Overview

The Cat Gallery App is an interactive web application that allows users to explore different cat breeds, like their favorite images, and leave comments.

- **Search for Cats:** Users can type a breed name in the search box to filter and view cat images based on breed.
- **Like Button:** Users can click the heart icon to like or unlike their favorite cat images.
- **Comment Section:** Users can add comments to individual cat images, which are then displayed below each cat card.
