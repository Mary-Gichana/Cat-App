# Cat Gallery App

## Project Overview

The Cat Gallery App is an interactive web application that allows users to explore different cat breeds, like their favorite images, and leave comments. It fetches cat data from a JSON server and dynamically displays it on a single-page interface. Users can search for cats by breed, like the images, and submit comments on each cat.

## Features

- **Search for Cats:** Users can type a breed name in the search box to filter and view cat images based on breed.
- **Like Button:** Users can click the heart icon to like or unlike their favorite cat images.
- **Comment Section:** Users can add comments to individual cat images, which are then displayed below each cat card.
